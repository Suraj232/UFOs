## Summary:
## Drawback: 
One of the major drawback is, user must already have an idea about what they are looking for and how the filter works. The filter section being case sensitive, users have to input the exact name to get the required information respectively.
### Recommendation:
1. The filter section being Case sensitive, user should enter the exact same name to get the result. So if we could make it non case sensitive then website would be easy to interact.
2. On the date section, user have to input the exact date. For example, if user enters only month and year of the date no results will be displayed. The flexibility to get the information is low. If an user wants to extract an information for a range of days then that operation is not possible to execute. I would recommend to add a extra filter to select the range of dates to make website more interactive.
